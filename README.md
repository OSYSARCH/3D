## WRC Lab shelves

Directory 3D_shelves contain rack shelves with trays for different devices under test (DUT)

Calculation of shelves needed:

1. 6x RPi4 + disks = 2 shelves
1. ykush switches x2, SBC C61 = 1 shelf
1. SBC B68, 2x relays, 2x nitrogens, 2x arduinos = 2+2+2+2 = 8 = 1.5 shelves

Total ~ 5 shelves
